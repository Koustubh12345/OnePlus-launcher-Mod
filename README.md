## 🚀 Features

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements
* **Dynamic Glassy Dock:** The dock background now features an auto-adaptive glassy blur effect that changes dynamically based on your wallpaper and icons.

### 🔄 Multitasking & Recents
* **Stacked Recents Layout:** Enabled the aesthetic "Stacked" card view for the recent apps screen on all supported devices, replacing the standard flat view.
* **Unlocked App Locking:** Removed system limitations that prevented specific apps from being locked in memory.
* **Enhanced Split-Screen:** Removed restrictions for Split Screen and Floating Windows, allowing more apps to utilize these features.

### 🔍 Custom Search Provider
* **Custom Package Target:** You are no longer forced to use the default Global Search.
* **How it works:** Go to Launcher Settings, type the **Package Name** of your preferred app (e.g., `com.openai.chatgpt` or `com.android.chrome`), and the Home Screen search bar will instantly launch that app.

### 🛠️ Under-the-Hood
* Removed various internal restrictions for a freer experience.
* General stability improvements and minor tweaks.
